Modelling policy proposals to Maryland Electricity Sector represented as Nash-Cournot game


# Enhancing the Policy Making Process for Maryland’s Energy Market

## Motivation:
In Maryland, where Coal-Fired Power Plants reign supreme, there is a long history of attempted policy and community activism to mitigate the harmful effects of burning coal. Ultimately, these efforts have not yielded sufficient results, due to high cost and repealed legislation. The goal of our project is to generate optimal policy proposals in order to minimize the tradeoff between economic performance and detrimental environmental effects within the energy market. Policy proposals will be expressed as taxes and capacities, that would act to curb production from heavy polluting energy providers, and make way for clean energy and renewables in the market.

## Research Questions:
There are a number of questions that must be researched to ensure the success of our program. Identifying the framework of the existing energy market, specifically the components necessary to capture within our model. Accounting for out-of-state energy producers and their impact on the Maryland energy market. Lastly, creation of a multi-period model: necessary for quantifying immediate and long term effects of policy proposals.

## Research Approach:
First a qualitative approach in understanding the market structure, necessary production quantities, and existing protocols and policies. Preexisting papers will be referenced in order to gain insight as to how energy markets have been modeled in the past, and which factors have been included due to their influence on the market. Then a quantitative research approach: collecting data as found fit from the qualitative research portion. This will include GHG emissions and financial data (i.e. Consumer Surplus and Producer Profits). Data will have to be structured by producer, and represent multiple years. 

## Methods from Class: 
A bi-objective mathematical program with equilibrium constraints will be created to encompass the entirety of the problem state; involving class methods such as game theory and complementarity. First, the energy market, and the relationship between production and pollution, must be modeled as equilibrium constraints. Next, the objective functions will be formulated as the goal of the government policy: minimizing environmental impact and maximizing the economic performance. In order to output a Pareto-Frontier of optimal solutions, a bi-objective optimization will be employed, yielding policies with varying emphases, from focusing solely on minimizing pollution to solely maximizing economic performance.

## Data Sources:
Data will be collected from a number of sources including: Maryland Energy Administration, US Energy Information Administration, and the Maryland Power Plant Research Program.
